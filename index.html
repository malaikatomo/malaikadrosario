                    <p>Hello, my name is Malaika D’Rosario. I am a computer engineering graduate from the University of Ottawa. 
                        In university,I was exposed to a variety of software and hardware tools that I utilized in my <u><a href="#myproject">projects</a>.</u> 
                        These projects have allowed me to collaborate with team members and work together to resolve the problem we encountered.
                    </p>
                    <p> During my undergrad I enjoyed designing and creating software in all my classes. Moving forward my goal is to create software 
                        that has an impact on the world, and that will leave a mark for future generations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>My current areas of interest include Web Development, Web Design, Software Engineer and Software Developer. I am 
                        currently seeking opportunities that will continue developing my current skills and give me the opportunity to learn new ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>In my free time I work on improving my skills and learning new ones by taking online classes. I am currently doing the CS50 web 
                        programming class on EDX offered by Harvard.

                    <h2>Civic Ottawa (website)</h2>
                    <p>This website was designed by me for a team of students for the 2019 federal elections in 
                        Ottawa using wix software. This website was a simplistic design and created to help youth and young voters find information 
                        on candidates and voting procedures. The intention was to create a clear view on the home page which resulted in over a 30% increase 
                        in interaction, allowing users to easily find the information needed and useful links to various other pages of content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website increased youth voters at the university of Ottawa by 40%. We were able to achieve a functional website and generate QR 
                        codes to make the website more accessible when marketing. <u><a href="https://www.civicottawa.com/">(see website)</u></a>

                    <h2>Autonomous Delivery Vehicle</h2>
                    <p>This project was taken on by myself and four other students to build an automated e-commerce solution where 
                        merchants can sell and deliver products on demand with the help of technology. In short a customer will order 
                        an item through an app, the vehicle will then find the item using QR codes via a camera and the claw will pick 
                        up the item, which will be delivered to a designated area to ship out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the early stages of the project I was tasked with doing research and designing the graphical user interface 
                        for the app, making it easy to use and aligned with similar e-commerce sites. After that my focus was working in 
                        a sub team of three to program the raspberry PI to scan QR codes and connect the PI to the database and ensure that 
                        the different parts of the system synced and worked successfully. At the end of this project our team created a 
                        functioning demo of the system.

                    <h2>Stay fit (Fitness app)</h2>
                    <p>
                        This app was designed by myself and two other classmates to help users track their health. It was built using Android 
                        Studio for a UI/UX class. The app has a simplistic design to allow users to understand the data easily and efficiently. 
                        Overall user experience increased by 20% after modifying how the data was presented to the user. Instead of having a number 
                        displayed, a visual representation was used to allow the user to see where they currently are and how far they are from 
                        their goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this app was to create a good heuristic prototype. Our focus while designing the app was a simple design 
                        and user feedback, so that the app could be more accessible to a larger range of users.

                    <h2>Taskify (Chore app)</h2>
                    <p>Lead a team of four in “An Introduction to Software Engineering” class, to design an app using android studio. Architected 
                        the design for the app, making it simplistic and easy to use. This included error messages to increase user feedback and 
                        visual representations (such as a calendar) to increase user experience. Improved the layout of information on the app making 
                        it 30% more minimal by using a summary of information, making the screen easier to read by the user. The purpose of this 
                        project was to create an app using new software that was introduced in a second year class.

                    <p>
                        As team leader my role included organizing team members, assigning scope of work and assisting, troubleshooting and resolving 
                        issues encountered. Held weekly meetings to ensure milestones  and the app deadlines were met. As this was our team's first 
                        introduction to the software initially there were a few roadblocks, but working together we were able to identify issues and 
                        resolve them accordingly resulting in a fully functional demo.
